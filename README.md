# An ERC20 token faucet on the Goreli Testnet 

This Dapp allows users to receive 100 FCT on the Goreli test net and to send FCT to other addresses. 

Having an erc20 faucet can be very useful for testing your Dapp, so I decided to make one.

It uses **hardhat**, **ethers**, **openzeppelin-contracts**,**react** and **bootstrap-react**, this is a powerful stack, and in this simple project shows some design patterns that can be expanded and explored to build powerful apps whilst creating powerful UI components fast.
